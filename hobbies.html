                      My most recent woodworking project. I made a computer desk with the rightside of the table's design taken from another project; the nightstand. 
                      However, I decided not to put a door and instead put a shelf in the middle. Total cost of this project at the time was approximately $90 CAD.

                    <p>
                      This was my first woodworking project. It is a three-legged stool. It is made from birch wood and the top was shaped with a wood lathe.
                      The legs of the stool were cut with a bandsaw and sanded down to its final size.

                    <h2>Night Stand</h2>
                    <img src="\images\nightstand.jpg" alt="" class="projectimage">
                    <p>
                      This night stand was my second project. Made from oak wood. Unlike the one on my computer desk, it has a door but no shelf on the inside. It is also smaller
                      than the desk version but just the right height for my bed. A darker finish was applied to this one compared to the computer desk.
